- Problem with serialization scene from simulator. Service has simulation engine as a partner (SimpleAckermanVehicle), it inserts AckermanFourWheelsEntity into simulator, entity appears and operational. Then save "scene as" - and there is no entity in xml. Webpost http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/roboticssimulation/thread/d5046d92-2a20-4693-a0bf-ac1c534422a3/ . It does not help. Workaround - create and delete AckermanFourWheelsEntity manual in simulator (Entity\New), then all works as expected. Maybe simulator loads needed proxy dll for Ackerman entity after explicit entity creation from iface.
